    "Q2.What is K-means clustering, and how does it work?\n",
    "Ans:-K-Means Clustering:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subsets (clusters). The goal is to group similar data points together and separate dissimilar ones. K-Means is an iterative algorithm that assigns each data point to one of K clusters, minimizing the sum of squared distances between data points and the centroid of their assigned cluster.\r\n",
